    <p>Laew sorn wa ya wai jai manood

        Gor mai kod muen nueng nai num jai khon

        Hai rorb korb kid arn na larn na

    <p>Do not trust others, he said:                     
    be afraid of the human mind.
            
            Even the most twisted of vines                 
            seems benign compared to the soul.
            
            Two people do have pure intent:              
            Your parents, who love with hearts whole.
            
            But destiny’s yours to control                    
            It’s your role to think on your own.
            
            Beware of even the friendly                      
            Cautiously think through all you’ve known.
            
            Knowledge is not enough, alone:
            The capstone is learning to survive. </p>

            <p>This poem is from one of Sunthorn Phu’s most renowned works, the epic of Phra Aphai Mani. The particular chapter from which this poem is drawn follows the story of Sudsakorn, who had been fooled and his magical items were stolen. His mentor, a hermit, magically appears and rescues him, then teaches him not to easily trust others, comparing the human mind to entangled vines. The hermit concludes by saying that self-reliance and knowing how to survive is the best of all traits. This particular selection from Phra Aphai Mani is a beloved classic and one of the most well known poems in Thailand.
